# FinetuneGPT

This project is a mini desktop app to interact with some GPT Davinci models I have fine-tuned (API key required). Relevant code and datasets for the fine-tunes are included.

- Frontend: HTML, JavaScript (Electron.js)
- Backend: JavaScript (Node.js, Express.js, OpenAI API), Python

## How to use

1. Clone the repository 
2. Install Node.js and run "npm install" in the console.


## Note

Although my API key is required to access the fine-tuned chatbots, you may use your own API key to create these fine-tunes using the procedures indicated and datasets included in the repository.
