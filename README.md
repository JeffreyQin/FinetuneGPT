# FinetuneGPT

This project is a mini desktop app to interact with some GPT Davinci models I have fine-tuned (API key required). Relevant code and datasets for the fine-tunes are included.

- Frontend: HTML, JavaScript (Electron.js)
- Backend: JavaScript (Node.js, Express.js, OpenAI API (GPT-3)), Python

## How to use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Node.js and run "npm install", "touch .env" in the console.
3. Type in "OPENAI_API_KEY = {{your api key}}" in .env
4. Run "npm run start" in the console.

## Note

Although my API key is required to access the fine-tuned chatbots, you may use your own API key to create these fine-tunes using the procedures indicated and datasets included in the repository.
